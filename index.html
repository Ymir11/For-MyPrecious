                    I dont know how much about to label the things i  feel<br>
                    all i know is that when i look at the sky, i see freedom.<br>
                    when i look at the dirt, i see breakthrough.<br>
                    when i look at the ocean, i see serenity.<br>
                    and when i look at you, i see everything.<br>
                    i love you enough to fight for you, compromise for you,<br>
                    enough to miss you deeply, no matter the lenght of time,<br>
                    or how far apart we are, enough to belive in our relationship,<br> 
                    to stand by your side, to hold your hand through the ups and downs,<br>
                    to have faith and strength in our relationship, to never give up on you,<br>
                    i love you enough to spend forever with you, each day i fall<br>
                    more in love with you, making me realize, no amount of time is ever enough,<br>
                    and even one day, forever will run out, but i decided that <br>
                    will be fine, because getting to love you is worth it, when death takes my hand,<br>
                    i will hold you with the other and promise to find you in every lifetime.<br>
